# lights-out-react
This game application was created using create-react-app. The game contains a board component which renders a table of cell components for the game board. The objective of the game is to disable all cell lights within the game board. Each game is randomly generated. Once a cell is clicked the cell along with its top, bottom, left and right neighbor will invert their current state. Continue inverting cells until you can turn off all lit tiles. Blue cells means the cell is lit and dark gray cells means they're not lit.
